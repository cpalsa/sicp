# *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* - Solved and Explained

The premise of this project is a simple one: complete all examples/problems in SICP and explain how and why they work.

##  Why?

It has been almost three years at the time of this writing since I have left academia with my undergraduate degree. In my professional work following my graduation I have only made use of a particular subset of my education. I have decided to undertake this as a personal refresher, while simutaneously creating a reference tool for those interested in learning the basics of computer science. The goal is not only to reconnect with the basics, but to provide a resource that is approachable to a beginner while also providing as much information as possible.

## Getting Started

This repository will be using the **second edition** of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

If you wish to follow along using this book, you can find it in its entirety online for free:
 * From official website **[here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)**, you can access the entire full-text version of the book in HTML. 
 * You may also find the unofficial ebook version **[here](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/)**.
 
 The official website also contains all the code samples from the book, making it easier than ever to jump in. 
 
 The examples in this book are all implemented using the programming language, LISP, using the Scheme dialect.
