# *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
The goal of this repository is a simple one: complete every example within the book, front to back, while reflecting on what can be learned within each challenge.

## Getting Started
This repository will be using the **second edition** of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*. If you wish to follow along using this book, you can find the unofficial ebook version (PDF) **[here](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf)**.
